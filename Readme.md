Problem - 

Thousands of stray animals die on streets everyday because of lack of timely medical intervention.
Injured or distressed animals are also a public health concern as they may get aggressive.
Government funded programs are too few and far between and just do not have the right tech resources available to be present where they are actually needed.

Solution - 

A potential solution to address the challenges faced by community animals on Indian streets, who are at risk of accidents and cruelty on a daily basis, involves harnessing the power of AI. This solution aims to connect concerned citizens, ambulances, nearby hospitals, shelters, and compassionate community caregivers in a coordinated effort to provide timely and immediate assistance to distressed animals.

By leveraging AI technology, we can create a system that matches the animal in distress with the closest available help and volunteers who are equipped to provide animal care. This innovative approach would not only empower citizens to assist animals effectively but also ensure that the relevant authorities and caregivers are promptly informed of the animal's location and condition. This way, we can enhance the overall well-being and safety of community animals while encouraging a more compassionate and responsive society.
